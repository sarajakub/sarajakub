hi, i’m sara jakubowicz [@sarajakub]

i like to make things and research tangible tech and immersive XR that enhances learning. ubiquitous tech and seamless interactions are king. i also like having fun with wearables.

i’ve decided to officially document my work to the world so enjoy my work w wearables, my weird ai agents, my alt.ctrl endeavors, a mix of all of these, and other quirky projects.

emails: sarajakubowicz@nyu.edu and sarajakub0@gmail.com.
